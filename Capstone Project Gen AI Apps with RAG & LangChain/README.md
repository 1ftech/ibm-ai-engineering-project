# 🧠 Build a QA Bot Web App

This repository contains the final project for the **IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate**. The goal is to build a **Question-Answering (QA) web app** powered by **LangChain**, **LLMs**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer questions based on uploaded PDF documents.

## 📌 Project Objective

The objective is to simulate a real-world AI use case:  
Build a bot that uses content from PDF documents to respond to user questions through a web interface. This includes:

- Loading PDF documents
- Splitting content into chunks
- Generating embeddings
- Storing/retrieving from a vector database
- Integrating with a language model
- Displaying a user interface using Gradio

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **LangChain**
- **OpenAI / Hugging Face LLMs**
- **FAISS / ChromaDB**
- **Gradio**
- **pdfplumber / PyMuPDF**
- **Python**

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Document Loaders** – Read and parse PDF files
- **Text Splitters** – Chunk long texts into manageable sizes
- **Embeddings** – Convert text into vector representations
- **Vector Store** – Store vectors for similarity search
- **Retriever** – Retrieve relevant documents
- **LLM Integration** – Generate answers from retrieved text
- **Gradio UI** – Simple web interface for interactive QA

## 🖼️ Screenshots

Screenshots of each step (loading, embedding, querying, UI) are stored in the `screenshots/` folder to support project evaluation.

## 📚 Skills Demonstrated

- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- LLM integration using LangChain
- Vector-based document retrieval
- Embedding generation and storage
- UI deployment using Gradio
- Real-world AI app architecture
