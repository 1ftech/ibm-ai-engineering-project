# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification with Pretrained Models: ResNet18, VGG16 & ResNet50

This repository contains my peer-reviewed assignments from the deep learning modules of the IBM AI Engineering Professional Certificate. The tasks focus on transfer learning using **pretrained CNN models** (ResNet18, VGG16, ResNet50) for **image classification** using both **PyTorch** and **Keras**.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Build an image classifier using **ResNet18** in **PyTorch**
- Build an image classifier using **VGG16** in **Keras**
- Compare the performance of the **VGG16** model with the previously implemented **ResNet50** classifier
- Evaluate and report model accuracy and other key metrics
- Complete peer-reviewed assessments in both frameworks

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **PyTorch**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **Transfer Learning**
- **Image Augmentation**
- **Pretrained Models: ResNet18, VGG16, ResNet50**
- **Jupyter Notebooks**

## üß† Learning Outcomes

- Practical implementation of **transfer learning**
